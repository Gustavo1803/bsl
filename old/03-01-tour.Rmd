- TODO: **Goal:** Train models that *generalize* well, that is, perform well on *unseen* data.
- TODO: Introduce data splitting:
  - Test-Train Split (`_tst` and `_trn`)
  - Estimation-Validation Split (`_est` and `_val`)
    - Where are these "weird" terms coming from?
    - Why not cross-validation yet?

- TODO: http://varianceexplained.org/r/ds-ml-ai/s

- TODO: define most of the terms that will be seen here
  - at least those that apply to both regression and classification
  
- TODO: This section is the heart of STAT 432.

- TODO: Note simplifications that we will use in this section.
  - No cross-validation
  - No data pre-processing
  - Minimial care for categorical variables
    - Either don't use them, or let the methods take care of them.
