Welcome to Basics of Statistical Learning! A better title for this book would be "An Introduction Machine Learning from the Perspective of a Statistician who uses R," but that's a mouthful. The goal of this book is to....


- Why R?


- Why this book?


- Why not (insert model here)?

- Where's the deep learning?

- Why so much simulated data?

- Why so few "sections?" I hate clicking. I like scrolling.
