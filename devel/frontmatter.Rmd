Welcome to Basics of Statistical Learning! A better title for this book would be "An Introduction Machine Learning from the Perspective of a Statistician who uses R," but that's a mouthful. The goal of this book is to lay the foundation for future machine learning work and study. You will learn the fundamental theory, as well as how to apply it in practice using the `R` programming language.

- There is a PDF version and a web-based HTML version, which should I use?
    - Please use the HTML version as much as possible. FIXME
- Why do you keep switching between calling it a book and a course?
    - Because this book is very strongly linked to STAT 432 @ UIUC. www.stat432.org.
- Why R?
    - Short answer: Because it's the language that I know best.
    - Long answer: I think it is easier to express probability concepts in `R` than in `python`. But again, my opinion is largely biased. I think it would be a fun exercise for a reader to "redo" the code from the book in `python`. I also think that the important things to take away form this book are actually language agnostic.
- Why this book?
    - A very good question, especially considering the huge number of machine learning books that already exist.
- Why not (insert model here)?
    - The idea behind this book is that after learning this material, you won't need (insert model here) presented to you in great detail. Instead, you'll be able to find an implementation of it in your language of choice, use it, and evaluate if it is appropriate.
- Where's the deep learning?
- Why so much simulated data?
- Why so few "sections?"
    - I hate clicking. I like scrolling. I loathe needing to click back to a previous section or chapter 
- Why not `tidyverse`?
    - I don't have a great answer to this question. I'll probably transition the book to more and more `tidyverse` over time.
- Why "statistical learning" instead of "machine learning"?
    - Heck, why not just "learning from data"? That's what were doing here.
- Why a whole new book instead of R4SL?
- FAQ: Why supervised last?
- FAQ: Why regression first?
