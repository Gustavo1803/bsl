# Machine Learning Overview



***

## Reading

- **Required:** [ISL Chapter 1](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf)
- **Required:** [ISL Chapter 2](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf)
  - This chapter is dense because it is an overview of the entire book. Do not expect to completely understand this chapter during a first read. We will spend the rest of the semester elaborating on these concepts. However, seeing them at the beginning will be helpful.
- **Recommended:** [Variance Explained: What's the difference between data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence?](http://varianceexplained.org/r/ds-ml-ai/)
