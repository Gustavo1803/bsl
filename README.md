# Basics of Statistical Learning

## IDEA

## TODO

- [ ] Add links in R4SL to note that this "book" exists
- [ ] Add `bookdown` support
- [ ] Add CI support
- [ ] Create list of packages used
- [ ] Decide if I should add these items as issues
- [ ] Write a probability, statistics, and estimation crash-course (the start of another book)
- [ ] Write an R, RStudio, and R Markdown crash course
- [ ] Setup a citation system
- [ ] Steal form R4Sl
- [ ] Find good KNN functions

## Chapters

- Frontmatter
- Introduction
    - Data Types (Move to appendix?)
    - What are the ML tasks?
    - A regression example
    - A classification example
    - A clustering example
- Probability? (As an appendix?)
- Estimation Theory, E[Y]
- Regression, E[Y|X]
- Classification, p(y|x)
- Resampling
- Modern Methods: Regularization and Ensembles
- Practical Data Analysis

## Misc

- "3D" plots like in regression overview
- EST, VAL, TRN, TST
- goal: 1. do, 2. understand
- main themes
    1. write a song. (start with a four chord song) 
    2. estimation. 
    3. do / understand
- Sort this into: books, classes, data, and misc

- http://seankross.com/2016/11/17/How-to-Start-a-Bookdown-Book.html
- intro datasets after pokemon: digits, powerlifting, chicago crime
		- limits of digits: preprocesses
		- limits of powerlifting: why would you predict deadlift?
		- limits of crime: ?

- add some of the practice problems to the end of each chapter?
- ask tyler to create python notebooks for each chapter?
- AI = function learning?
- keep a list of packages and why we're using them (and repeat within chapters?)
- 0-1 BVD?
- use FNN for knn
- ML != DS
- () for functions?
- [] for expectations?
- practice in book?
